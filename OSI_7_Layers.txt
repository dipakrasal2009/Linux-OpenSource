=>  7 layers OSI model 

1. Physical Layer
2. Data Link Layer
3. Network Layer
4. Transport Layer
5. Session Layer
6.Presentation Layer
7. Application Layer

 1. Physical Layer:
	-> it represent lowest level of data transmission
	-> refers to row unstructured data bits
	-> and process converting them electrical signals
	     for device to read
	-> Phycial Hardwares : Network Hub, modems, adapter
						    cabling and network controllers
						    work in this layer
	-> Bluetooth, Ethernet and USB describe phycical layer
		specification.


2.  Data Link Layer : 
	-> deals with data packageinto frames
	-> Technologies in this layer assist in node to node data transfer
	-> this layer divided into two sublayers : 
		1 Media access controle : host node connect with one another
		2 Logical Link Controle : which checks for errors and orchestrates
						   frame flow and synchronization
	-> data link layer protocol is point to point protocol(PPP)

3.  Network Layer : 
	-> this layer is responsible  for sendin and receving fata frames structured in packets.
	-> Technologis : use routers to send packets to nodes on different networks
	-> the network layer might split or fragment the message if it exceed the maximum network packet size

4. Transport Layer : 
	->
