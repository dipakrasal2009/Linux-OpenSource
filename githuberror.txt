ssh: Could not resolve hostname github.com: Temporary failure in name resolution
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.



The error indicates that your system is unable to resolve the hostname github.com, likely due to a DNS or network issue. Here are steps to troubleshoot and resolve this problem:

1. Check Internet Connectivity
Verify if your internet connection is working by pinging a website:
bash
Copy
Edit
ping -c 4 google.com
If this fails, resolve your internet connection issues first.
2. Check DNS Resolution
Test if your system can resolve github.com:
bash
Copy
Edit
nslookup github.com
If this fails, try changing your DNS settings to use public DNS servers like Google DNS or Cloudflare:
Edit the /etc/resolv.conf file:
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf
Add the following lines:
Copy
Edit
nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 8.8.4.4
Save and exit. Test again.
